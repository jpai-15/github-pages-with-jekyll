Brag Sheet: I am an AP Scholar with Distinction. I also received the EB Women's Club Aware before graduating from East Brunswick High School. I will be attending New 
  Jersey Insitute of Technology's Honors College as a Human Computer Interaction. During my free time, I like to listen to music, 
  cook, hangout with friends and read.
